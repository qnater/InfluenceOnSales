1) Check that the similar products are linked to books/movie/...
2) Check that every products have 5 similar
3) Data persitency (fast, feature, store, ...)
4) Be sure about centrality and not just recommender
5) Heterogenous nodes (careful)


#sophie
- check if the similar products always belong to the same category
â€”> if it is the case: the graph will have components, treat then them separately
- either way, take the category information into account
- in general: take advantage of the complexity of data / of all informations given in the dataset
- better define the component analysis (also: what do we define popularity)
